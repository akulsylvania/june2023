\subsection{Equation for Energy in an Electromagnetic Wave}
\footnote{Introduction to Electrodynamics by David J. Griffiths}

The total energy density (u) in an electromagnetic wave is given by the following equation:

\[
u = \frac{{\varepsilon_0 E^2}}{2} + \frac{{B^2}}{2\mu_0}
\]

Where,
\\ $\varepsilon_0$: permittivity of free space
\\ E: Electric field strength
\\ B: Magnetic field strength
\\ $\mu_0$: Permeability of free space.

\subsection{What is Energy in an Electromagnetic Wave?}

\\ The Energy Density of an Electromagnetic Wave refers to the amount of energy carried by the wave in a unit volume region of space at a given time. The first term, $\frac{{\varepsilon_0 E^2}}{2}$, represents energy associated with electric fields, while the second term, $\frac{{B^2}}{2\mu_0}$, represents the energy associated with magnetic fields. The synchronization of these two components propagates the wave through space. Understanding Energy Density of electromagnetic waves plays a crucial role in understanding the interaction of waves in optics, wireless communication and transmission. We recently came across this formula and concept in our physics course (PH1020) in Electrodynamics. I chose the equation for the same reason and the fact that it includes lots of new symbols.
